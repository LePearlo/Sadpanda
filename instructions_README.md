# Dependecies
- Qt5
- PyQt5

# How to run
1. Navigate to version -> gui -> gui_constants.py
2. Assign PIXMAP_PATH a string with path to an image, e.g: C:/your/image.png (choose an image with close to identical w & h for best results)
3. Navigate to root folder and run main.py

# What to expect
Well, not much yet... The grid view took alot of time to get right.
At the moment you can only select an item, and rightclick to show contextmenu.
Next step for me is implementing clicking for an item, then i'll
implement a model/view for chapters.
The code is currently a mess. Since this is my first time using PyQt,
i'll be saving alot of old code, and run the risk of making spaghetti code.
